## Superstore Data  

### Creating a relational database
We strive to reduce their dependency on multiple spreadsheets of data, which in turn reduces the time spent on finding information. For this purpose we offer a database system that will streamline the data requests and reports. Queries can be used to find exactly what they are looking for, while also removing the unnecessary information that creates clutter during the decision making process. 

This system also reduces the errors often caused by the inconsistency of data that is redundantly stored in various places. In the case of making an update in one spreadsheet, but not in another, the hassle of pulling information that is accurate is solved. When one wants to make a change, the system will determine whether this change is possible within certain constraints (integer, NOT NULL, etc) and the change will be consistently reflected throughout the entire database. This enhances the overall performance of the application, allowing for more powerful use of the data.
